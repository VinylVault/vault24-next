      <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
      <p className="big">
        Like most website operators, The Vinyl Vault collects
        non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and
        servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
        preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor
        request. The Vinyl Vault’s purpose in collecting non-personally
        identifying information is to better understand how The Vinyl Vault’s
        visitors use its website. From time to time, The Vinyl Vault may release
        non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
        publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
      </p>
      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      <p className="big">
        The Vinyl Vault also collects potentially personally-identifying
        information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users
        and for users leaving comments on https://www.thevinylvaultshow.co.uk
        blog posts. The Vinyl Vault only discloses logged in user and commenter
        IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
        personally-identifying information as described below.
      </p>
      <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
      <p className="big">
        Certain visitors to The Vinyl Vault’s websites choose to interact with
        The Vinyl Vault in ways that require The Vinyl Vault to gather
        personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information
        that The Vinyl Vault gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.
        For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at
        https://www.thevinylvaultshow.co.uk to provide a username and email
        address.
      </p>
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p className="big">
        The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but
        remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of
        electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially
        acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot
        guarantee its absolute security.
      </p>
      <h2>Advertisements</h2>
      <p className="big">
        Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising
        partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to
        recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement
        to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This
        information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted
        advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This
        Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by The Vinyl Vault and does not
        cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

        third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy
        and terms and conditions of every site you visit.
      </p>
      <p className="big">

        privacy policies or practices of any third party sites, products or

        The Vinyl Vault discloses potentially personally-identifying and
        personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,

        provide services available at The Vinyl Vault’s website, and (ii) that

        potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
        information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other
        governmental request, or when The Vinyl Vault believes in good faith

        rights of The Vinyl Vault, third parties or the public at large.

        just keep you up to date with what’s going on with The Vinyl Vault and
        our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of
        information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If
        you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our
        feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to
        help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other
        users. The Vinyl Vault takes all measures reasonably necessary to
        protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction
        of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
